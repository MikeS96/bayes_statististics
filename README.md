# Bayesian Statistics Specialization in Python 

This repository is a Python implementation of the different algorithms and problems proposed in the the courses [Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics), [Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mcmc-bayesian-statistics) and [Bayesian Statistics: Mixture Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mixture-models) offered by the University of California Santa Cruz in Coursera.

The main idea is to provide a Python-based implementation in order to enable people who is not familiarized with R to play and learn Bayesian Statistics.

**Note**: Quizes and projects are not shared in this repository, only examples given within the lectures. All the text, equations and explanations were directly taken from the course.
